**Warhammer 40k Web Scraper :)**

Objective: The warhammer community website updated their web page and in the process got rid of their RSS feed. This motivated me to build a web scraper to post new links to a discord channel. It runs 4 times a day, finds links to new article, makes sure to not post duplicate articles via .json, and posts them in a certain discord channel.
